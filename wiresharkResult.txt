🧪 Wireshark Analysis

I used Wireshark to observe network traffic during my Nmap TCP SYN scan.

🎯 Key Observations:
- My system (`192.168.76.8`) sent **SYN** packets to every IP in `192.168.76.0/24`.
- Devices with open ports responded with **SYN-ACK**:
  - `192.168.76.122:3306` → MySQL service confirmed open
  - `192.168.76.184:53` → DNS service confirmed open
- Devices with closed ports responded with **RST** packets or didn't respond at all (filtered).
  
📸 Screenshot/Packet Sample:
- Packet 1: `SYN` from `192.168.76.8` to `192.168.76.122:3306`
- Packet 2: `SYN-ACK` from `192.168.76.122:3306` back to my machine
- Packet 3: `RST` response from closed port (example shown in file)

📁 Capture File:
The Wireshark capture (`wiresharkResult.pcapng`) is included in the repository for reference.
